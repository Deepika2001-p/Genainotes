Set :  set is a collection of well defined objects.interms of probability it defines collection of     possible outcomes.

example : A = {1, 2, 3, 4} → A set of numbers  
          B = {apple, banana, mango} → A set of fruits  

                               Types of sets


|   Type        |   Definition                              |   Example                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Empty Set     | Has no elements                           | ∅ or {}                                      |
| Singleton Set | Has only one element                      | {5}                                          |
| Finite Set    | Has a fixed number of elements            | {1, 2, 3}                                    |
| Infinite Set  | Unlimited elements                        | Set of all natural numbers                   |
| Equal Sets    | Same elements                             | A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 1}                       |
| Subset        | Every element of A is in B                | A ⊆ B                                        |
| Proper Subset | A ⊂ B and A ≠ B                           | (no explicit example, implicit)              |
| Universal Set | Contains all elements under consideration | U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}                          |
| Power Set     | Set of all subsets of a set               | P(A) for A = {1, 2} = {{}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}} |


                              operations of set

1. Union (A ∪ B)
All elements from A and B.

A = {1,2}, B = {2,3} → A ∪ B = {1,2,3}

2. Intersection (A ∩ B)
Common elements in both.

 A = {1,2,3}, B = {2,3,4} → A ∩ B = {2,3}

3. Difference (A − B)
Elements in A not in B.

A = {1,2,3}, B = {2,4} → A − B = {1,3}

4. Complement (A')
All elements not in A (from universal set).

If U = {1,2,3,4}, A = {1,3} → A' = {2,4}
