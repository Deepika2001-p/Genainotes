Counting Rules
Used to count the number of ways events can happen.

a. Multiplication Rule
Definition:
If one event can occur in m ways and another in n ways, both together can occur in m × n ways.

Example:
Choosing 1 of 3 subjects and 1 of 2 time slots →
3×2=6 total options.

Simple Event Probability
Simple Event:
An event with only one outcome.

Example:
1 out of 5 students is selected for a prize.
P(choosing Deepika) = 1/5.

Venn Diagrams
Definition: A diagram that shows all possible logical relations between sets/events.

Example:

Set A = Students who take Math

Set B = Students who take English

A ∩ B = Students who take both

A ∪ B = Students who take at least one

Outside A ∪ B = Students who take neither.

Factorials (n!)
Definition: Product of all positive integers up to n.
              n!=n×(n−1)×…×1
Example:
Ways 3 students can sit in 3 chairs:
            3!=3×2×1=6

Permutations
Definition:
An arrangement of items where order matters.
n
 P = n!/(n−r)!
r
​
 
Example:
Ways to assign 1st and 2nd rank to 4 students:
4
 P = 4!/(4−2)! = 4! = 12.
2
​
​
Combinations
Definition:
A selection of items where order doesn’t matter.
n
 C = n! / ​r!(n−r)!
r
​

Dependent Probability
Definition:
When the outcome of the first event affects the probability of the second.

Formula : P(A and B)=P(A)×P(B∣A)
Example: From 10 students (4 girls), select 2 without replacement:

1st girl: 4/10

2nd girl: 3/9

𝑃(both girls)= 4/10 * 3/9 = 2/15.
